# WeatherWise
There is something about knowing the weather that is comforting...

There are very few instances in which we can know a little bit about what the future will be like.
 Weather is one of those things where someone can predict what's to come and be right. Having that kind of stability about the scary unknown is nice.

# GitHub rules and guidelines
• Clone the repository to your machine

• Create your folder with only one css and js

• Create your own local branch (git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME)

• Push to your remote branch of the repository (git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME)

• Don't create any extra folders or files UNLESS they are added to your .gitignore

• Don't edit the gruntfile.js

• NEVER work on or push to the master branch

• Once you have finished 'milestone' sections of code: first push to your remote branch so it's up to date, then push to the master-dev branch and resolve any conflicts

• We should merge to master-dev often to keep conflicts resolved

• Every time master-dev gets merged, other team members will be notified by the team leader and then MUST switch to the master-dev branch locally and pull so they stay up to date

• Only at the very end will we merge a conflict-free master-dev into the actual master branch
