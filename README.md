# WeatherWise
There is something about knowing the weather that is comforting...

There are very few instances in which we can know a little bit about what the future will be like. Weather is one of those things where someone can predict what's to come and be right. Having that kind of stability about the scary unknown is nice.

Weatherwise is a contemporary App which brings you more than the daily forecast. Minimilistic design is paired with coherent data to bring a unique and powerful user-interface to your disposal.

## GitHub team instructions
• Clone the repository to your machine

• Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal

• Check node version is at least 10 (node -v)

• Check npm version is at least 6 (npm -v)

• npm install

• install grunt cli (npm install -g grunt-cli)

• grunt (ALWAYS run 'grunt' command before doing any work)

• Create a sass partial in /src/scss as: _yourname.scss

• Create a script file in /src/js as: yourname.js

• Edit main.scss to enable your partial

• Create your local branch (git checkout -b yourname)

• Push your local branch to the remote repository (git push -u origin yourname)

• Files not related to the project must be added to the .gitignore

• NEVER work on or push to the master branch

• Once you have finished 'milestone' sections of code: first push to your remote branch so it's up to date, then push to the master-dev branch and resolve any conflicts

• Create your local version of the master-dev (git checkout -b master-dev)

• Every time you merge to the master-dev branch, let the other team members know. They MUST switch to the master-dev branch ASAP and pull (git checkout master-dev) + (git pull origin master-dev) Once this has been done you can switch back to your branch and continue working

• Merge to master-dev often to keep conflicts resolved
