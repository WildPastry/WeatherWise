# WeatherWise
There is something about knowing the weather that is comforting...

There are very few instances in which we can know a little bit about what the future will be like.
 Weather is one of those things where someone can predict what's to come and be right. Having that kind of stability about the scary unknown is nice.

# GitHub rules and guidelines
• Clone the repository to your machine

• Create your folder with: gruntfile.js, css & js

• Create your own local branch (git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME)

• Push your local branch to the remote repository (git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME)

• Don't create any extra folders or files UNLESS they are added to your .gitignore

• NEVER work on or push to the master branch

• Once you have finished 'milestone' sections of code: first push to your remote branch so it's up to date, then push to the master-dev branch and resolve any conflicts 

• Every time you merge to the master-dev branch, let the other team members know. Then they MUST immediately switch to the master-dev branch locally and pull (git checkout -b master-dev) + (git pull origin master-dev) Once this has been pulled you can switch back to your branch

• We should merge to master-dev often to keep conflicts resolved

• Only at the very end will we merge a conflict-free master-dev into the actual master branch
